It supports reading of single lines or whole frames. ## The decoder The most important types for decoding purposes are `Decoder` and `Reader`. They both wrap a `std::io::Read`. `Decoder` serves as a builder for `Reader`. Calling `Decoder::read_info` reads from the `Read` until the image data is reached. ### Using the decoder     use std::fs::File;","items":[[3,"PixelDimensions","png","Pixel dimensions information",N,N],[12,"xppu","","Pixels per unit, X axis",0,N],[12,"yppu","","Pixels per unit, Y axis",0,N],[12,"unit","","Either Meter or Unspecified",0,N],[3,"FrameControl","","Frame control information",N,N],[12,"sequence_number","","Sequence number of the animation chunk, starting from 0",1,N],[12,"width","","Width of the following frame",1,N],[12,"height","","Height of the following frame",1,N],[12,"x_offset","","X position at which to render the following frame",1,N],[12,"y_offset","","Y position at which to render the following frame",1,N],[12,"delay_num","","Frame delay fraction numerator",1,N],[12,"delay_den","","Frame delay fraction denominator",1,N],[12,"dispose_op","","Type of frame area disposal to be done after rendering this frame",1,N],[12,"blend_op","","Type of frame area rendering for this frame",1,N],[3,"AnimationControl","","Animation control information",N,N],[12,"num_frames","","Number of frames",2,N],[12,"num_plays","","Number of times to loop this APNG.  0 indicates infinite looping.",2,N],[3,"Info","","PNG info struct",N,N],[12,"width","","",3,N],[12,"height","","",3,N],[12,"bit_depth","","",3,N],[12,"color_type","","",3,N],[12,"interlaced","","",3,N],[12,"trns","","",3,N],[12,"pixel_dims","","",3,N],[12,"palette","","",3,N],[12,"frame_control","","",3,N],[12,"animation_control","","",3,N],[3,"Transformations","","Output transformations",N,N],[3,"Decoder","","PNG Decoder",N,N],[3,"Reader","","PNG reader (mostly high-level interface)",N,N],[3,"OutputInfo","","Output info",N,N],[12,"width","","",4,N],[12,"height","","",4,N],[12,"color_type","","",4,N],[12,"bit_depth","","",4,N],[12,"line_size","","",4,N],[3,"StreamingDecoder","","PNG StreamingDecoder (low-level interface)",N,N],[3,"Encoder","","PNG Encoder",N,N],[3,"Writer","","PNG writer",N,N],[4,"ColorType","","",N,N],[13,"Grayscale","","",5,N],[13,"RGB","","",5,N],[13,"Indexed","","",5,N],[13,"GrayscaleAlpha","","",5,N],[13,"RGBA","","",5,N],[4,"BitDepth","","Bit depth of the png file",N,N],[13,"One","","",6,N],[13,"Two","","",6,N],[13,"Four","","",6,N],[13,"Eight","","",6,N],[13,"Sixteen","","",6,N],[4,"Unit","","Physical unit of the pixel dimensions",N,N],[13,"Unspecified","","",7,N],[13,"Meter","","",7,N],[4,"Decoded","","Result of the decoding process",N,N],[13,"Nothing","","Nothing decoded yet",8,N],[13,"Header","","",8,N],[13,"ChunkBegin","","",8,N],[13,"ChunkComplete","","",8,N],[13,"PixelDimensions","","",8,N],[13,"AnimationControl","","",8,N],[13,"FrameControl","","",8,N],[13,"ImageData","","Decoded raw image data.",8,N],[13,"PartialChunk","","",8,N],[13,"ImageEnd","","",8,N],[4,"DecodingError","","",N,N],[13,"IoError","","",9,N],[13,"Format","","",9,N],[13,"InvalidSignature","","",9,N],[13,"CrcMismatch","","",9,N],[12,"recover","png::DecodingError","bytes to skip to try to recover from this error",9,N],[12,"crc_val","","Stored CRC32 value",9,N],[12,"crc_sum","","Calculated CRC32 sum",9,N],[12,"chunk","","",9,N],[13,"Other","png","",9,N],[13,"CorruptFlateStream","","",9,N],[4,"EncodingError","","",N,N],[13,"IoError","","",10,N],[13,"Format","","",10,N],[0,"chunk","","Chunk types and functions",N,N],[5,"is_critical","png::chunk","Returns true if the chunk is critical.",N,[[["chunktype"]],["bool"]]],[5,"is_private","","Returns true if the chunk is private.",N,[[["chunktype"]],["bool"]]],[5,"reserved_set","","Checks whether the reserved bit of the chunk name is set.
